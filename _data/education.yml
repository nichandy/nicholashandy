    During my time at San Francisco State University I have gradually gained an understanding of how computer hardware works. Currently my coursework has involved both theoretical concepts and hands-on work with hardware. In our engineering labs I have developed a better understanding of hardware development works by building an audio amplifier from start to finish.
