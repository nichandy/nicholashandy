    Pensieve is a chrome extension that connects to the ethereum block chain to secure user information and provides notification of at risk data. We started this project to apply what we had been learning during our summer intership using a AGILE development methodologies to manage our progress. This project was an incredible learning experience and showed us just how much we could learn in the 8 weeks had to work on the project.
