<!-- My Story with Amber Wave -->

Starting in 2020 I worked with a pair of electrical engineers to develop the software for the Amber Wave network as part our senior design project. I worked on multiple aspects of the project including coding hardware components in C and developing and deploying a web application to communicate with multiple types of nodes.

- Developed a full stack web application to process environmental sensor data from ESP-32 based microcontrollers developed by the hardware team
- Integrated RabbitMQ message broker to ingest and store sensor data coming from connected devices
- Designed a RESTful backend server to support the storing of sensor data to for long-term analysis
- Collaborated with hardware team to plan and design of device prototypes for new use-cases
